# Network2Secwork
Follow my journey from Network Engineer to Penetration Tester

*** This is a work in progress, discussions in this readme are subject to change and my opinions can and most likely will change throughout writing ***

1. Tools

 - Nmap
 - Wireshark
 - Netcat
 
 Before I embarked on my security journey, I had already had a grasp on each of these tools, how to use them, when to use them. Although it be from a blue team perspective, knowing how to use them, read them, and when to use them proved to be invaluable as these tools are probably going to be used every day.
 
 I had dabbled in some of the red team scenarios with these and utilized them on a frequent basis even as a network engineer.
 
 1.1 Languages
 
 Prior to the starting of this journey I also had some languages under my belt. Specifically programming/scripting languages that can/did/will prove handy in the coming subjects.
 
 PowerShell, Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, batch and ***some*** bash.
 
 1.2 Operating Systems
 - Linux - Most debian based distros (CentOS, Ubuntu, Kali)
 - Windows - Every OS since XP (including Server)
 
 1.3 Knowledge // Experience basis
 
 Over the years I have found that the security field in general is very much experience based, gaining knowledge, retaining important knowledge, designing and fixing existing infrastructures will prove to be invaluable and assist in foresight and possibly pursuable attack vectors that fall within your scope of work as a pentester.
 
 1.3.1 - Books
  Throughout my career I amassed a collection of books, some of them networking, others security, and some system administration based. Here are my suggestions for books:
   - Powershell in a month of lunches
   - Hello World Vol. 3 Python
   - Network Security Bible
   - Red Team Field Manual
   - Blue Team Field Manual
   - Web Application Hacker's Handbook
   - BurpSuite Essentials
   - The Art of Exploitation
   - CCNA study guide

    *** Keep your eye out for free online Capture The Flag competitions to practice against other people ***
    
    *** Keep your eye out for Security conferences in your area regardless of whether or not they are red or blue team. I frequent GrrCON :) ***
    
    Discord is another very valuable resources with rooms
       The 3 that I've found most fruitful are:
          - InfoSec Prep
          - OSCP
          - Cisco Study Group
          - NullzSec
          - ByteLounge
