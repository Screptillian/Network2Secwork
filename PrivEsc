After obtaining a low level shell, There's a few paths you can take to escalate your priveleges. You can:
  - Enumerate services that may help you
  - Enumerate permissions on files like /etc/shadow (readable/writable)
  - Look at other people's shells
  - Look at environment variables
  - Look at the cronjobs (readable/writable)
  - SUID / SGID (Set User ID / Set Group ID executables)
  - Look at the command history for other users
  - Configuration Files/ssh keys for other users
  - Mount an NFS share on your attacking machine and run an elf payload (Root squashing on the share disabled)
  - Look for vulnerabilities in the Kernel (last resort)
  
There are several tools at your disposal to find privelege escalation:
  - LinEnum.sh
  - linpeas.sh
  - lse.sh
